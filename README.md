# NOMAD Dev Distribution

Benefits

- One-step installations: Install everything at once with editable mode. Since all packages are installed in editable mode,
  changes you make to the code are immediately reflected. Edit your code and rerun tests or the application as needed,
  without needing to reinstall the packages.
- Centralized codebase: Easier navigation and searching across projects.
- Better editor support: Improved autocompletion and refactoring.
- Consistent tooling: Shared linting, testing, and formatting.
- Flexible plugin management: If you're developing plugins for different deployments
  with varying requirements, you can easily create different branches for each deployment
  and configure which plugins to use in the specific branch for that deployment.

Below are instructions for how to create a dev environment for developing [nomad-lab](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/nomad-lab) and its plugins.

## Basic infra

1. Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.
   Docker nowadays comes with `docker compose` built in. Prior, you needed to
   install the stand-alone [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (v0.5.14 and above).
   uv is required to manage your development environment. It's recommended to use the standalone installer or perform a global installation.
   (`brew install uv` on macOS or `dnf install uv` on Fedora).


3. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)(v1.22). We will use it to setup the GUI.

4. For Windows users, nomad-lab processing doesn't work natively on the platform. We highly recommend using the [Devcontainer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) 
plugin in VSCode to run the repository within a container, or alternatively, using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) to run the project.

5. Clone the forked repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nomad-distro-dev.git
   cd nomad-distro-dev
   ```

6. Run the docker containers with docker compose in
   [detached](https://docs.docker.com/guides/language/golang/run-containers/#run-in-detached-mode)
   (--detach or -d) mode.

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   To shutdown the containers:

   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```

## Developing nomad + plugins locally.

This guide explains how to set up a streamlined development environment for nomad-lab and its plugins using
[`uv` workspaces](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/#workspaces).
This approach eliminates the need for multiple pip install commands by leveraging a monorepo and a single installation step.

In this example, we'll set up the development environment for a developer working
on the following plugins: `nomad-parser-plugins-electronic` and
`nomad-measurements`. The first plugin already comes as a dependency
in this dev distribution. On the contrary, the second plugin is not listed as a
dependency. In the following, we take a look at how to setup the environment in
these two situations.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Update submodules

   This loads the `nomad-lab` package which is already listed as a submodule.

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
> [!TIP]
>
> To get more information on how to use git submodules are used to structure bigger
> software projects, read the this [Github blog entry](https://github.blog/open-source/git/working-with-submodules/) on this topic.

2. Add local plugins

   Assuming that you already have a git repo for your plugins, add them to the
   `packages/` directory as submodules. In case, you are looking to create a plugin
   repo from scratch, consider using our plugin template:
   [nomad-plugin-template](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-plugin-template).

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/<package_name>.git packages/<package_name>
   ```

   Repeat for all the plugin packages you want to add and develop. For our example:

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/nomad-coe/electronic-parsers.git packages/nomad-parser-plugins-electronic

   git submodule add https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-measurements.git packages/nomad-measurements
   ```

3. Modify `pyproject.toml`

   To ensure `uv` recognizes the
   local plugins (a local copy of your plugin repository available in `packages/` directory),
   we need to make some modifications in the `pyproject.toml`.
   These include adding the plugin package to `[project.dependencies]` and
   `[tool.uv.sources]` tables.
   The packages listed under `[tool.uv.sources]` are loaded by `uv` using the local code
   directory made available under `packages/` with the previous
   step. This list will contain all the plugins that we need to actively develop in this environment.

   If a new plugin is **not** listed under `[project.dependencies]`, we need
   to first add it as a dependency. After adding the dependencies, update the
   `[tool.uv.sources]` section in your `pyproject.toml` file to reflect the new
   plugins.

   There are two ways of adding to these two lists:

   * You can use `uv add` which adds the dependency and the source in `pyproject.toml`
   and sets up the environment:

     ```bash
     uv add packages/nomad-measurements
     ```

   Or if you've added multiple plugins as submodules, you should list them all together.

   ```bash
   uv add packages/nomad-measurements packages/PLUGIN_B packages/PLUGIN_C
   ```
 
   * You can modify the `pyproject.toml` file manually:

     ```toml
     [project]
     dependencies = [
     ...
     "nomad-measurements",
     ]
  
     [tool.uv.sources]
     ...
     nomad-measurements = { workspace = true }
     ```  
   
   Some of the plugins are already listed under
   `[project.dependencies]`. If you want to develop one of them, you
   have to add them under `[tool.uv.sources]`. We do this for `nomad-parser-plugins-electronics`.
  
   ```toml
   [tool.uv.sources]
   ...
   nomad-parser-plugins-electronic = { workspace = true }
   ```

 > [!NOTE]
 > You can also use `uv` to install a specific branch of the plugin without adding a submodule locally.
 >
 > ```bash
 > uv add https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-measurements.git --branch <specific-branch-name>
 > ```
 > This command will not include the plugin in the `packages/` folder, and hence this plugin
 > will not be editable. 

A complete list of plugins maintained by FAIRmat-NFDI can by found in the [overview page](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI) of the FAIRmat-NFDI organisation.

    
### Day-to-Day Development

After the initial setup, hereâ€™s how to manage your daily development tasks.

1. Update the environment (This step installs the necessary dependencies):

   ```bash
   uv run poe setup
   ```

   As part of the setup command, a `nomad.yaml` config file will be created, this file is used to configure nomad. 
   It will be placed in the top-level directory of your repository, where all commands are executed from.

   For more information on configuration options, refer to the detailed [nomad configuration docs](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/reference/config.html#setting-values-from-a-nomadyaml).


> [!NOTE]
>
> `uv sync` and `uv run` automatically manages the virtual environment for you.
> There's no need to manually create or activate a venv.
> Any `uv run` commands will automatically use the correct environment by default.
> Read more about `uv` commands to manage the dependencies [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#managing-dependencies).

2. Running `nomad` api app (equivalent to running `uv run nomad admin run appworker`).

   ```bash
   uv run poe start
   ```

3. Start NOMAD GUI

   ```bash
   uv run poe gui start
   ```

> [!TIP]
>
> `uv run poe gui` maps to `yarn run`, so here you can replace `start` with commands like `test`, `build`, etc.

4. Run the docs server (optional: only if you wish to run the documentation server):

   ```bash
   uv run poe docs
   ```

5. Run the remote tools hub server (optional: only if you wish to use the remote tools hub):

   ```bash
   uv run poe hub
   ```

6. Running tests

   To run tests across the project, use the uv run command to execute pytest in the relevant directory. For instance:

   ```bash
   uv run --directory packages/package_name pytest
   ```

   This allows you to run tests for a specific parser or package. For running tests across all packages, simply repeat the command for each directory.

> [!TIP]
>
> To run tests for a specific package in an isolated venv use: `uv run --exact --all-extras --package plugin_a --directory packages/plugin_a pytest`

7. Linting & code formatting

   To check for linting issues using ruff, run the following command:

   ```bash
   uv run poe lint
   ```

   You can invoke ruff separately using `uv run ruff` too.

8. Adding new plugins

   To add a new package, follow [setup guide](#step-by-step-setup) and add it into the `packages/` directory and ensure it's listed in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.uv.sources]`. Then, install it by running:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

9. Removing an existing plugin

   To remove an existing plugin from the workspace in `packages/` directory, do the following and commit:

   ```bash
   git rm <path-to-submodule>
   ```

   Then you can remove the plugin from `[tool.uv.sources]` in `pyproject.toml` to
   stop uv from using the local plugin repository.

   Additionally, if you want to remove the plugin from being a dependency of your
   NOMAD installation, you can use `uv` to entirely remove it:

   ```bash
   uv remove <plugin-name>
   ```

10. Modifying dependencies in packages.

   ```bash
   uv add --package <PACKAGE_NAME> <DEPENDENCY_NAME>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   uv add --package nomad-measurements "pandas>=2.0"
   uv remove --package nomad-lab numpy
   ```

11. Generating gui test artifacts and nomad requirements files

    ```bash
    uv run poe gen-gui-test-artifacts
    uv run poe gen-nomad-lock
    ```

12. Keeping Up-to-Date

    To pull updates from the main repository and submodules, run:

    ```bash
    git pull --recurse-submodules
    ```

    Afterward, sync your environment:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The nomad instance will be available on http://localhost:3000/fairdi/nomad/latest/gui, and expects to find the nomad API on localhost:8000, and the remotes tool hub on localhost:9000. If you are running the instance on a remote server, make sure to forward these ports locally.  
> As an alternative way to port forwarding, the backend URL for the GUI can be configured too. For that, the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` in `packages/nomad-FAIR/gui/.env.development` can be modified to the appropriate API url.

### Updating the fork

To keep your fork up to date with the latest changes from the original repository (upstream), follow these steps:

1. Add the upstream Remote

   If you haven't already, add the original repository as upstream:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev.git
   ```

2. Fetch the Latest Changes from upstream

   Fetch the latest commits from the upstream repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. Merge upstream/main into Your Local Branch

   Switch to the local branch (e.g., main) you want to update, and merge the changes from upstream/main:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   Resolve any merge conflicts if necessary, and commit the merge.

4. Push the Updates to Your Fork

   After merging, push the updated branch to your fork on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. Failed to install phonopy.

   ```console
      uv venv -p 3.12
      uv pip install 'numpy>=1.25'
      uv pip install 'phonopy==2.11.0' --no-build-isolation
   ```

2. Failed to install pycifrw.
   
   The error usually indicates that clang was missing. `error: command 'clang'`. Installing `clang` should fix this issue.
